<p><strong>What's The Story?</strong><br>
There’s no denying it: the popularity of cupcakes has taken the nation by storm! Some say this cupcake craze began when Carrie Bradshaw on Sex in the City just had to have her cupcake fix from New York City bakery, Magnolia. Whatever the case may be, the cupcake’s popularity has soared in the last few years.
<br><br>
Why? The cupcake takes us back to the days when we were kids, and everyone knew that a cupcake meant one thing: P-A-R-T-Y! That’s why our Cupcake in Bloom™, a selection from our exclusive Everything Cupcake™ collection, really takes the cake!
