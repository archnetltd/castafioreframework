It arrives in a bakery box with a set of candles where available, and with proper care, can last days after the celebration is complete! Birthday Flower Cake® is available with pastel-colored or bright-colored flowers. Cake plate not included. Components may vary. Arrangement measures approximately 7"H x 8"D.<!--<hr><br /><div class="small"><i>"Everyone loved the flower cake and never saw anything like it before.</i>"</div><div class="small" align="right">- Brian (Milford, NH)</div><br /><div class="small"><i>"The pastel flower cake was even more beautiful than the picture.
